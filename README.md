Post climate change movement around the world, individuals especially those who belong to younger generation, seem to be more concerned about their physical health over everything and would want to live in a safe and healthy neighborhood. People would want to change to a location where that neighborhood offers a healthy environment. Individual's health is largely determined by physical environmental factors surrounding their residence. This paper focuses on Assessing the neighborhood condition using many factors like, Air quality index, water quality, crime rate, opioid influence among people in that neighborhood.We attempt to use clustering model which would classify the unlabeled data that we obtained using the above mentioned data sets into two classes and then would calculate the weighted distance between class and the data point and assigning this normalised distance as score for scoring label. Regression model will then be used to determine the scoring label for unknown data. With these scores available, Individuals can now take right decisions about the neighborhood they would move into.
